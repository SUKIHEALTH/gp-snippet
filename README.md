# 🧠 GP Snippet Creator (with AI & AHK)

This tool was created out of necessity by a GP. My previous text expansion tool stopped working with my HIS system — so I built one that works locally, is AI-powered, and lets me save and run my own consultation snippets.

💻 This demo app:
- Lets you create, save, and run AutoHotKey text snippets
- Generates SOAP Plan (P:) snippets using GPT-4o
